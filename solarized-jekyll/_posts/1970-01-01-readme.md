# Thank You

This is a custom adaptation of [Solarized theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized){:target="_blank"} based on the Jekyll Minimal theme.

The code highligther color scheme is an adapation of the [Intellij version of Solarized](https://github.com/jkaving/intellij-colors-solarized){:target="_blank"}.

If you want to modify some things, go on the "assets" folder and edit main.scss.
For more modifications, this is on the "_sass" folder.

By default, you are on the dark version. You can switch to the light version by editing de $theme variable in main.scss.

``` scss
//Line 9
$theme: light;
```

*There is maybe (for sure) some useless css code. It comes from the base theme*
