# Solarized Theme for Jekyll (v3)

**Work In Prgress**
I'm reworking the scss. I find an issue on the solarized-light highligther color scheme.
I'll remove this warning when the issue is done.

**DEMO** : https://rphlmr.github.io/jekyll-solarized-theme/

This is a custom adaptation of [Solarized theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) based on the Jekyll Minimal theme.

The code highligther color scheme is an adapation of the [Intellij version of Solarized](https://github.com/jkaving/intellij-colors-solarized).

# How to use

All is on the "solarized-jekyll" folder. 

Copy this folder and use it like a classic jekyll project.

Don't forget to modify your _config.yml

# More

If you want to modify some things, go on the "assets" folder and edit main.scss.
For more modifications, this is on the "_sass" folder.

By default, you are on the dark version. You can switch to the light version by editing de $theme variable in main.scss.

``` scss
//Line 9
$theme: light;
```

*There is maybe (for sure) some useless css code. It comes from the base theme*
